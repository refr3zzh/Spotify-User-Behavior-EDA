# Spotify-User-Behavior-EDA
In this project we aim to answer very important business decisions on behalf of Spotify.

Spotify, being a music streaming platform, would have a wide range of questions it would need to answer from its user behavior data to improve its service, enhance user experience, and drive business decisions. Here are some major questions Spotify might seek to answer:

User Engagement and Retention:

1. How frequently are users listening to music on Spotify?
2. Are there specific time periods when user activity is higher?
3. Which user group engage with the platform the most over time?

Content Consumption Patterns:

4. What genres or artists are the most popular among different user segments?
6. Are there patterns in the type of content users consume during certain activities (e.g., working out, studying)?

Personalization and Recommendations:

7. How effective are the recommendation algorithms in suggesting relevant songs or playlists?
8. What features contribute to users' satisfaction with personalized recommendations?
9. How often do users save recommended songs to their libraries?

Playlist Creation and Sharing:

10. How frequently do users create and modify playlists?
11. What prompts users to share playlists with friends or on social media?

Impact of New Releases and Discover Weekly:

26. How do user behaviors change when new albums or songs are released?
27. What is the engagement rate with the Discover Weekly playlists?
