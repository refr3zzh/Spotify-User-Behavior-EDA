# Spotify-User-Behavior-EDA
In this project we aim to answer very important business decisions on behalf of Spotify.

Spotify, being a music streaming platform, would have a wide range of questions it would need to answer from its user behavior data to improve its service, enhance user experience, and drive business decisions. Here are some major questions Spotify might seek to answer:

User Engagement and Retention:

1. How frequently are users listening to music on Spotify?
2. Are there specific time periods when user activity is higher?
3. Which user group engage with the platform the most over time?

Content Consumption Patterns:

4. What genres or artists are the most popular among different user segments?
5. Are there patterns in the type of content users consume during certain activities (e.g., working out, studying)?

Device and Platform Usage:

6. Which devices and platforms (mobile, desktop, smart speakers) do users prefer for music streaming?

Some general analysis: 
1. Conversion and Monetization
2. Customer feedback and rating
3. Podcast listening frequency

These are just a few examples of the many questions Spotify's user behavior data could help answer. By analyzing these aspects, Spotify can continually refine its service, tailor its recommendations, and create a more enjoyable and personalized experience for its users.
